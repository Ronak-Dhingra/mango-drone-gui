### Project Description
This repository contains the code for the Mango project done in my second year (April 2023). The project is a handheld GUI for drones. The GUI is built using React Native and Expo. The backend is built using Python and Socket.IO. The backend is used to simulate the drone and send data to the frontend. The frontend is used to control the drone and receive data from the backend. The frontend is hosted using Expo. The backend is hosted using Python.


### Project Features
- Designed a feature-rich Android application using React Native and Expo, orchestrating the visualization of drone
operations and functionality including a status bar, alert bar, and swipe bars for intuitive actions.
- Leveraged Socket.IO in the backend to enable seamless communication between the application and the drone
simulation script.
- Orchestrated collaboration using Taskade and GitLab, ensuring effective team coordination, version control, and
project management throughout the development process.

### Project Motivation
- The current drone graphical user interfaces for handheld devices cannot provide a user-friendly experience for controlling, monitoring, and receiving telemetry data and video feeds from the drone's cameras.
- This hinders the ability of the drone to perform its specialized functions effectively and creates a disconnect between the information gathered by the drone's sensors and the user's intended actions.
- An app-based solution is needed to provide an environment with various modes and features that will allow for a seamless interface between the drone and the user.

### Requirements

- React Native:- To develop the web-app. 
- Expo:- To host our React Native app for Android.
- Android device
- python3-venv:- To install python dependencies for the simulation.

### Usage
- Navigate to the `src` folder and run the start script to run the expo and simulation server 
- The `diagrams` folder contains the various diagrams we used during conceptualization and iterative development of the project.
